# Quickstart

Install _RSpec Documentation_:

```console
$ gem install rspec-documentation
```

Initialize your project:

```console
$ rspec-documentation
```

A placeholder `000-Introduction.md` file with a basic example spec will be automatically generated.

The documentation generator will provide you with a link to your interactive documentation bundle. Open it in your browser and then start adding specs to more _Markdown_ files. When you're ready, upload the static documentation bundle to your favourite _CDN_.
